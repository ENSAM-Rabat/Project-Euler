<h1 align='center'>Sum square difference</h1>
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
<br>
<center>
    $1^2+2^2+...+10^2 = 385$
</center>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

<center>
    $(1+2+...+10)^2 = 3025$
</center>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is<br>

<center>
    $3025 - 385 = 2640$
</center>
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
